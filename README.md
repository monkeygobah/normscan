## Make average CT scan structures

Algorithm takes as inpuy any number of CT scans (as stl file) and creates an average model. Works for longbones and skulls, but primarily developed for skulls.

User selects relevant anatomy to provide correspondance for registration via iterative closest points algorithm. Following this, a surface model is created and average models can be built. Paper submitted for publication. See figures below for more detail on methodology and outputs
